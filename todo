removed support for non-freetype font, added font levels, broke arrows, added --line-spacing parameter, --fisheye
----

only register grammar if root.reregister is set. Only render if root.rerender. 
#Only output grammar debugging info if --debug-grammar
#only parse if Parser.reparse




#total split or threading? reading https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock

add --server to main_sdl and main_curses

accepts tcp connection, creates some 
client object
  .proxy is a weakref dict from some int

for tag in tags:
  if type(tag) == ElementTag:
    proxy[len(proxy)] = weakref(node)

    
    
split Ref and TypeRef




continue work on user-defined syntax, at this point, functions serve that role, completely?

we have unevaluated arguments, so a function body can be thought of as a rule for
evaluating the node. there could be other rules: display, debugging..?..

streamline things. what are
*elementary nodes - text, number, ..,? how can we formalize their definition in terms of a nodecl(?) and python code?
*nodes that define a language? nodecl, worksas, definition, syntacticcategory, exp.. syntax definition node..
*nodes of some language itself? customnode?

>return a generator that appends each item of collect() to _collected and yields it
return <value> is a node
generator is a node
<node> that <???>  - attribute?
<node> and <node>
appends <x> to <y>
..etc, see ACE and i7 etc
...then formalize code generation





create actions module, handle everything thru Action objects, try undo/redo



optimize rendering of scrolled frames






frames:
#todo: function definition / insight frame? preferably able to float in multiple numbers around the code
#status / action log window <- with keypresses too
#toolbar (toolbar.py)
#settings, the doc?



modules: how to declare imports, how to denote in menu items that a function is
from some module..
dbpedia node
todo:pip search hjson
#todo:xiki style terminal, standard terminal. Both favoring UserCommands
#first user command: commit all and push;)
