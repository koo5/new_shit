* finish the parser
* finish snipplr integration


* experiment with mycroft skills
* experiment with storing nodes in a triplestore
* new gui framework: sseehh's or pyside or whatever


* continue hacking on the mockup language: add Identifier as a fallback for parsing identifiers not in scope(?)


* subclass module into a repl, move cursor into it upon start


* continue work on user-defined syntax, at this point, functions serve that role, completely? (?)
we have unevaluated arguments, so a function body can be thought of as a rule for
evaluating the node. there could be other rules: display, debugging..?..


* optimize rendering of scrolled frames

* new languages:
** narsese
** guisese - for controlling seh's gui
** editorsese - all actions available in the editor, handle everything thru Action objects, add undo/redo


*gui frames:
#todo: function definition / insight frame? preferably able to float in multiple numbers around the code
#status / action log window <- with keypresses too
#toolbar (toolbar.py)
#settings, the doc?




* make a simplified personal-assistant ui
* add support for android apis alla commandr and automateit
* improve lemon language, add a rule system
* profit



    
    
split Ref and TypeRef






streamline things. what are
*elementary nodes - text, number, ..,? how can we formalize their definition in terms of a nodecl(?) and python code?
*nodes that define a language? nodecl, worksas, definition, syntacticcategory, exp.. syntax definition node..
*nodes of some language itself? customnode?





modules: how to declare imports, how to denote in menu items that a function is
from some module..
dbpedia node
todo:pip search hjson
#todo:xiki style terminal, standard terminal. Both favoring UserCommands
#first user command: commit all and push;)

functors relating objects at different levels of abstraction 
theoretical: embed the system into the untyped lambda calculus
theoretical: embed the system within a self-interpreter
expand the CoC to a pure type system, taking an SAR triple
  and matching data-types & methods for them



Applications (besides Tau & everything we already know Tau will be used for)
---------------------
*If we make a tech product, then the programmer should find it logical but the
 customer should find it magical.

Mathematical applications
--------------------------

Geometric reasoning
Topological reasoning




Programming applications
---------------------------
Automated language-to-language program/logic translation
Typed machine code

Program verification according to formal specifications (we've already done this! crazy!)
Hardware verification according to formal specifications (ultimately this is just a very
  special & sophisticated case of the same activity as program verification)
Verification of engineering design according to formal specifications relative to a formally
  specified framework of physics (yet another very sophisticated case of the same activity as
    program verification)

Determine time & space complexity of programs
Find minimal program matching specifications

   side-chains, 
   smart-contracts, 
   cryptocurrencies
   nomics
