currently F8 switches between arrows and highlighting (technical issue with drawing). With arrows disabled, 
the background of the node in cursor will be dark red.
#writing context sensitive help and then dumping it is just...hmm#nvm#if i wasnt putting off integrating a widget toolkit,
the context sensitive thing would work. all the global keys would be in a menu.

this could work?

global keys
===
#all quotes are gone. okay
ctrl + =,- : font size
f9 : only valid items in menu - doesnt do much atm
f8 : toggle the silly arrows from Refs to their targets
f5 : eval
f4 : clear eval results
f2 : replay previous session keypresses
ctrl + up, down: menu movement
space: menu selection
ctrl - delete : try to delete current node
ctrl - g : tries to generate a graph from the code tree, with pydot ( pip install pydot )
and write it as graph.gif
ctrl - d : save a dump of the root frame as dump.txt


nodes
===

red <>'s enclose nodes or other widgets
green [text] are textboxes, you can type and maybe backspace


Compiler 
==
better name would be parser.
looks like this: {(type)}
(in gray) is the expected type
the contents of Compiler, if not empty, is text with embedded nodes, maybe like this:
{make me a <*sandwich>}
you should be able to edit the text, more or less, and insert nodes from the menu.
this "text with nodes" thing isnt useful yet, but will be the basis of lemon interaction


lists:
==

<<->(type)
    (type)
    (type)>

is probably a list.
<-> is a expand / collapse button
program statements is a node that is more or less a list, too
enter somewhere in the list body inserts new line/item


numbers
==
like lists, but they have clickies

<<->4<+>>

dont go below zero!


tutorial?
===

when you start lemon, you should see:
program:
    <module:
    <<->{(statement)}
        {(statement)}
        >end.>
builtins:
    <module:
    <<+>>end.>
>

syntax
===
lemon is contantly changing, but here are some hints before things become more clear in lemon itself:
root contains modules, currently one "program" and "builtins"
a module contains Statements, which is a list of Statement
Almost everything works as a statement, including expressions
some statements: For, If, VarlessFor, FunctionCall, FunctionDefinition
FunctionDefinition needs a signature. Thats a list that contains either Text or TypedArgument
TypedArgument contains a name (Text) and a type (Ref)
a For contains an item name (Text) and an expression evaluating to a List
