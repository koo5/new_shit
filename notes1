code completion
i think this is solved with marpa
this is about the language object, and how it should be able to find all next legal tokens by a breadth-first search of the language syntax space - smarter than usual autocompletion - optimization of the menu

interesting discussion about this in the augmented programming mailing list, just ask there.

old - the pyglet gui
AnkhMorporkian_> thoughts i have though. there has to be a good message passing protocol defined between objects.

AnkhMorporkian_> it would be much easier to add syntax checking for each object and just report valid or invalid, so you could like color the offender red or something

AnkhMorporkian_> secondly, i think a lot can be done with decorators instead of creating a bunch of truly different GUI objects.

>> presentations

# Disable error checking for increased performance
pyglet.options['debug_gl'] = False







old ponderings

data format: check
text inputting: check (phase 1)

option 0:
use blockly

option 1:
continue remaking blockly in python
slap a keyboard cursor and autocompletion onto it, make an editor for ACE (inside it). Im not comfortable with the idea of two and later more modes: the main, outer, AST blocks  (scratch). A special mode inside an ACE block for editing ACE.  
must learn ace + prolog...
where is RACE hidden? or how do we do the reasoning? how does it connect..

option 2: 
spawn a new language with the phase 1 editor, must learn making parsers..
this is already a win here, because an unobtrusive semantic aware editor should allow for a better language than i7

option 4: 
editor for i7

---

dummy object should have a type property, specifiing the type of blocks it accepts (within the language ast space)
dummy changes into inputty, text box + menu
menu is filled by the language object
chain nodes
attempt compilation
...

goals:
the AST of the program is given by the nesting of the gui elements
basic elements:
element
text
textbox

?
containers:
horizontal container - a line
vertical container - lines
indented lines

?
node - ast node base class
- children acessible by name
- presentation given by a nodetype node
nodetype:
presentation attribute -  
later todo - presentation editor

simple way:
type


typetype:
    

either generic function call or a special node type
AppLaunch

do:
    functioncall(lib=base, name=launchapp, ….
    or
    baselib.launchapp(s.lib,s.name,s.params)
presentations =
[
lines(line(s.icon, s.name))
lines(line(s.icon, text(“launch”), s.name))
]

setpos
getrect

event architecture?






still not happy with the blocks format, how about this:
would be nice to generate the language block descriptions from ACE texts...//->fuxi or pyke
 pyswip-> prolog



phase 2a:
evaluate alice pascal and the jetbrains thingy
either continue recreating the basic visual language functionality in python or use google blockly
google blockly - a scratch clone - blocks in js. Possible base.
http://code.google.com/p/blockly/source/browse/trunk/language/common/control.js
add cursor and full keyboard control
add menu for adding blocks
 also for ace words - extendable with other kinds of items


phase 3?
ace expression block:
contains subblocks - words
use the editor from phase 1?
makes words available in menu according to ace syntax and vocabulary - 
http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/docs/authoring_tools.html
freakin javascript again..->blockly?
bnf block? math expressions. this should be but isnt(?) fully supported by ace




i dont even know
text editor mode:
concrete syntax tree based
(vs eclipse text based and mps ast based)
mapping to text and back

markdown as a first language
c syntax mode
higher constructs should map to function calls




language “base” cluelessness of mine
how to do the right thing?
prolog or lisp?

TextNode
    # value
NumberNode
    # value
ListNode
    # value
UseNode
    # module, node, with(arguments)
    syntax(): node.syntax()
SyntaxNode
    #input->editing
DefinitionNode
    # body, 
ChildToken

builtins = UseNode(module = 'builtins', node = 'module', with = 
{
    'name' : TextNode("builtins module")
    'body' : ListNode(
    [
        SyntaxNode(of = 'module', body = ListNode(
        [
            TextNode("module"),
            ChildToken(TextNode("name")),
            TextNode(":"),
            ChildToken(TextNode("body"))
        ]? etc etc

homoiconicity, atoms, lists vs StatementsNodes...
shrug

outdated - tight integration into picolisp
the plan is to start with a working language - picolisp for now, rewrite what worked in the last python prototype - from the bottom up to a working projectional editor
implement new constructs as lisp functions
allow editing of any (transformed) lisp
first just read-only text representations tho
hcml-hyper code markup language-text marked up with appearance and linked to ast nodes -  what we fed to pyglet
bits - formerly templates - define the syntaxes of function calls
lemon as an EDSL in picolisp
http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StumblingBlocksForDomainSpecificLanguages
 - unless all the logic and reflection make us move to a logic programming language?
or migration to CL for libraries? can use java and c libraries
need metadata in ast nodes - wrapping of nodes
 - another option is ast nodes as objects, and rolling our own eval loop
another layer of objects are the gui objects hierarchy


#frontend to picolisp, once again?
PicolispParser
	standalone tokenizer
	some parsing required for special symbols?
	keeping nodes in the background - this has to be figured out anyway
	not gonna go into how the HLL would live above that, but things are becoming clearer

"lenses":
lense is a custom node
it is declared in some included module
we are in a "console" node - basically a statements list,
ctrl-enter executes current line
the syntax is "songmeanings" <songmeanings search text>
before prolog integration, menu can directly offer the songmeanings node. Asks songmeanings search text node for
autocomplete
SongmeaningsSearchText is a custom node...
in the guts, some sort of asynchronous def songmeanings_autocomplete(text) returning SongmeaningsSearchText nodes with data
or maybe SongmeaningsAuthor, SongmeaningsSong..

#rendering speed
limiting the amount of lines rendered by render() is kinda useless until
we can limit if from the top, that is, not call render(root) but render(some other element)
and that needs thinking thru but must be doable. Simply dont care if something up there above
the screen changes. Touches upon textual vs nodal navigation. As does deleting children.
draw_lines could be speeded up with cython or something


#literals, syntax
* (?)or start extending the way Syntaxed specifies syntax now, like, for List, it would be '[', ListItemWithComma*, ListItem?, ']'
* ListItemWithComma, ListItem...implies the concrete syntax nodes would co-exist with the AST nodes..(?)

#other todo options:
* triples: predicate definition node, accepts Text or URL as subject and object
* math notations
* add more notes to nodes
* bring shadowedtext back

#
or start working out what is needed for the more natural way of editing
you dont want to deal with a tree hierarchy all the time, instead,
just a flat list of tokens that keep background information
but i think what i got so far is relevant

"IP systems also offer several levels of detail, allowing the programmer to "zoom in" or out. In the example above, the programmer could zoom out to get a level that would say something like:
<<print the numbers 1 to 10>>"

tacitness aka implicitness

* triples: predicate definition node, accepts Text or URL as subject and object

we should start thinking about some scenegraphotoolkitoframeworkthing
i want to define all my keypress and mouse responses declaratively

stuff that lemon wants to use:
pypy:
pypy compiles your rpython-annotated code into a JITting interpreter. how cool is that?
but it makes interacting with ctypes (?) based c extensions slow.
http://morepypy.blogspot.cz/2014/03/pygamecffi-pygame-on-pypy.html
pygame_cffi wasnt finished, missed drawing something lemon needed, last time i checked

https://bitbucket.org/pypy/compatibility/wiki/Home#!gamemultimedia-libraries

kivy:
graphics framework
compatible with pypy: doesnt look like happening. it is written in Cython, a sort of
contender to pypy
but, if we split frontend and backend..hmm..
<kovak> there is nothing to stop you from using Kivy's providers directly<kovak> one of which is SDL<kovak> there has even been a recent discussion about a more low level text api


simple options:
tkinter:
try how tkinter works with pygame (would events go thru pygame or tkinter? 
its probably a hour of work to update the events handling, several more to 
rewrite new_shit.py ...
maybe i dont want to fight with a standard toolkit about focus.
https://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2012-September/091417.html

pygame gui libs:
ocempgui isnt packaged, does it work from source tree?
pgu



libavg: cool, but too much of a moving target?


so, what do we want:
access to SDL_ttf or other low level text drawing, preferably with both software and opengl backends

at some point make lemon distributed, with ipython or some object proxying lib.
each window or computer can display different frames. i never did this kind of thing, 
so i dont know performance-wise where it will be best to make the "cuts"


at some (distant) point, change to rpython, start using pypy

we want graphics, opengl, but compatibility with non-accelerated machines too
(an option to disable wild graphics and still run)

what widgets do we want: for a start, panels to embed lemon frames in. with the line
between them that you can drag to resize them. then maybe tabs. maybe file open dialog
some of these things would be fun to do in lemon widgets but why.
also, we may find that using standard widgets is useful, maybe popping up around lemon
code or something, maybe that text editor.
So yeah there would be both lemon text-o-widgets and some different widgets. but who cares.


oh, and im eyeing pyglet again. 


if somebody will want to do a JS version, there are python-to-js compiler/interpreter projects. what would be the implications of their use for $above/of $above for their use?





hard stuff to get done: 
>Compiler.on_keypress: maybe some abstraction like this_is_left_bracket_of_item_1, this_is_...
understand yield python or try pyDatalog again or .. /me cries

markdown and html? maybe..markdown and rst and maybe others is what github
then renders
sorry, im not making much sense today thats fine
another option would be to use markdown mode in emacs, i tried some 
web markdown editor yesterday, it was like, semi wysiwyg, its enough
if the emacs mode is like that, that would be cool
except the learning emacs part

==section== hows that?fine
im thinking tho, the === sections as markdown does this are fine,
it hardly ever conflicts with anything..except the forgotten merge conflicts

(http://example.tld/x/y/z): click me!
hows that?hmm, as long as it makes sure its a link inside the parentheses
but then you dont need the parentheses
parens make it easier to parseok

hmm
trying to work out newlines in the simplest way
cant s/\n/\n\n/
so, what are you doing, generating markdown?
yes. it expects two spaces at the end of line. i would just add two spaces everywhere
really  that  sounds  like  it  would  work  fine.i mean at line ends ok
would be damn nice to actually detect those merge conflict lines..and just throw a warning
or something, just dont let markdown make them into those huge headinh
what are the conflicts?





possible todo path towards an useful language:
===
save/load:
	identification

copy/paste	

python eval:
	class variable for environment	
	phase 2: PythonEvalText, menu, __dict__

structs



priorities: 
persistence -> settings
PythonFunction

lesh:
start with a Lesh node - thats the command line
later: history or more fancy (xiki style) stuff or whatever
one child of type LeshCommand
->creates parser
hack parser to offer LeshSnippet
based on current word, not whole text
or some boundary (|), this is also where you need to split the text into tokens
hack(subclass?) snippet menu item to insert plain text

pygame font
===
pygame loads/uses some default font that doesnt support some unicode glyphs
what font would you like? maybe ubuntu? i have no idea hmm
..apparently ubuntu has a lot of unicode glyphs . i just know that we cant bundle a cool free unicode font because of the license
but lemon could try to download it, in the installer? in the installer it doesnt have
where does ubuntu keep it's fonts? i think i know where osx does
dunon, theres gonna be some environment var and stuff
deja vu sans? it's on by default on the linux distros ive seen, windows, and osx, and has really good unicode support
i dunno. i guess this task is bogus. It might be more important if we wanted to render math symbols for example
i just thought it would be nice to have some unicode glyphs for buttons but the font loaded by pygame by default didnt have them
if you can figure out how to make pygame look harder or something..i dunno
well, you cant make pygame look harder, 
cant you just get the os, check in it's 'fonts' folder, check for the font, if not found then use the default without cool unicodes?
yeah, something like that. Maybe just try loading some better one and pygame will fall back to default if not found

	explosion should replace a node with an Unknown for each TextTag and with its

pondering
===
* the client and server can either be both the same language and we could use some way of just proxying the python objects, this has the advantage that we might be able to more easily play with rendering fun stuff in the frontend (VPython) or we go full separation/serialization. Shrug.
* try changing the input handling to make Parser simple (and working) (left_keypress, right_keypress, middle_keypress)
* emit python or picolisp?
* exploding nodes
* finish the curses interface (keyboard input handling)







http://bugs.python.org/issue18172
















"The editors in some integrated development environments parse the source code and generate a parse tree, allowing the same analysis as by a structure editor, but the actual editing of the source code is generally done as raw text."
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_editor
what is the additional work tht a structured editor has to do? user interaction with the projected nodes, meaning with the node objects themselves, as opposed to just generating text and reparsing as necessary...

ponderings
===
* revive the_doc.py, the settings module, the toolbar, add support for images or live graphic canvas..

* support for more human languages.
 would make lemon interesting as a non-english programming tool
 i think this is an easy task. A syntax defined in python code is a list of tags.
 Sometimes you may see them grouped in another list, so there are several alternatives.
 I would wrap each tags list in a dict with additional metadata: "lang" and maybe "verbosity"..  

* help me learn unipycation, yield python <http://yieldprolog.sourceforge.net/> , kanren or other logic programming
  (learning logpy currently, and liking it)
 it will be needed for a lot of features of lemon.
 you dont actually need to know lemon to help me with this

* improve the user interaction with nodes or the context help "system"

* give me feedback on the builtins module, it should serve as a reference to the language, with documentation and examples. 

* migrate the google doc to something saner? github wiki? the_doc.py?
