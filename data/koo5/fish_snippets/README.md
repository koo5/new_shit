and this directory to your PATH and source hmm:
```
set PATH ~/homegit/hackery/hmmfish/ $PATH
cd ~/homegit/hackery/hmmfish/
. hmm
```




limitations/future:
there are only so many useful snippets that dont require arguments or tinkering and fit all on one line.  
so, we need a way to distribute/reference script files.  
when a snippet is selected, it should be possible to supply parameters, but usually tinkering is needed, so an editor could be opened with a copy of the script..  
we are also limited by fish's autocompletion mechanism.  (although, fish is pretty hackable!)
browse for example http://snipplr.com  
heres a nice one: http://snipplr.com/view/74925/install-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu/  
then we could ofc talk about dynamic fetching from web and stuff..
