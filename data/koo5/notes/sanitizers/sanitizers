MSAN and ASAN are mutually exclusive. valgrind is exclusive with both. 
ASAN does not check for use of uninitialized memory. MSAN requires all libraries be
recompiled with it






ASAN_OPTIONS=symbolize=1,detect_leaks=0,strict_init_order=1,check_initialization_order=1,verbosity=1,detect_stack_use_after_return=1
qmake:
