help wanted
===
here are some (random and possibly outdated) things that i think would help lemon further, sometimes directly, sometimes by making it more
accesible/interesting to other people. Some understanding of lemon is usually
necessary though. I will be more than happy to explain every detail, but be prepared that it takes some time.
some (messy) notes are also notes1, and search for "todo" in the source files..

* add more standard library functions, operators for strings and lists
* help developing the license
* look into runnig lemon in pypyjs or compiling it to asm.js
* improve the curses frontend, figure out what keys to use
* do more research on or write comparisons of related projects (projectured, cedalion, MPS, eastwest..)
* figure out how to have a better font in pygame (for mathy expressions, for example) compatible with lemon license (search notes1 for 'font')
* improve logging, use: (todo)
* integrate some test framework
* lemon needs a better data model for the ast nodes. Looking into oldman, or pure rdflib, or a rewrite in another language. Or into graph libraries. And inferencers..
* alternatively, lets try to do with what we have now and use lemon for user shell-like features or editing triples or narsesse or anything
