Lemon comes with this weird license because i can't justify to myself
spending so much time working on it with no hope of any income ever.
I know there are "secondary" ways to make money on open source projects,
but in my situation and medical condition, and with the "meta", "take-over-
the-world" nature of the project, they don't seem realistic.
If you think we can work something out, i'm all ears, as well as if you
want to contribute under your conditions.

This is just a preliminary sketch that wouldn't pass as a proper license.
You have to accept future modifications and rewrites.
