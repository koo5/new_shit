only as an intellectual exercise for now:

a subclass of ParserBase?
this seems obscure but thats what the node does, parses the text inside it

my dream doc format:

*this will be a grammar independent of the lemon language


*with a lexer:
links
markdown-style headings






parser keys:
ctrl [ and ] : inc/dec the heading level



links should be clickable, sections collapsible
this could be done on the level of the text in the Parser, but thats not
what we're interested in. We want to instead have Link and Heading nodes,
and have them function seamlessly with the rest of the text
and created/destroyed based on the results of the tokenizer, on every change
