#what is this?
This is visionary and evolutionary stuff. I meet people who want to do great stuff, but dont have years of free time to spend researching whats out there. I wish i could outline where their dreams fit in the jigsaw and get them started.

#levels
most ideas can be described on several levels, from the most down-to-earth, realistic and timid, to the crazies take-over-the-world visions.


#topics
that come up, how they relate, what are our options, highest and lowest level visions.
UIs
GUIs
augmentation
languages
intelligent agents

```<HMC_A> 14:34 < sirdancealot> i meet many people that want to change things but i dont know how to build an army of them
<HMC_A> you don't need to meet them! Just build a "DAC"/"DAO" to do the particular change and if the change is a change worth making the army will come to it?
<HMC_A> if you want to see some change just fire up your tau client and make some new context in which to start a push for the change...
<HMC_A> not sure if politics.... or implementation detail ;-)
<HMC_A> changing things is a game.  It is a process with inputs/state controlled by many participants. As naturalog pointed out wisely, this is the definition of game.
<HMC_A> build your "MMO change the thing".... whether "the thing" is debian desktop configs or a virtual lab or a club or a theory about magmas or a corporation or a .....
<HMC_A> and if your change has *value* your army will come to play your game, naturally.
<HMC_A> I know some "more remote" cultures have words for this concept that I know I lack in english.... hehe```

```<sirsleepalot> even tau is more
<naturalog> well not really: all tau aims is to generalize the bitcoin's decentralization as broad generalization as possible
<naturalog> and to be a platform for any other application
<naturalog> this time, that can be ran synced between distinct nodes
<naturalog> without assuming trust between them
<naturalog> this is a new paradigm in software, that began with bitcoin, and we want to generalize it```
