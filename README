dependencies
===
needed:
python3.4 (?)
fuzzywuzzy - for basic ordering of the menu

recommended:
cffi and libmarpa - needed for parsing
apt-get install python3-cffi
or
pip3 install --user cffi
https://github.com/jeffreykegler/libmarpa.git

apt-get install python3-pip python3.4
pip3 install --user fuzzywuzzy

the pygame frontend requires pygame, obviously  
python3 pygame:
https://packages.debian.org/experimental/python3-pygame
http://pygame.org/wiki/CompileUbuntu
https://launchpad.net/~thopiekar/+archive/ubuntu/pygame <- seems to not include freetype


running it
===
src/sdl_client.py

if the latest commit doesnt run, git checkout HEAD^ until you find one that does:)


getting started
===
some context sensitive help is in the sidebar.  
Stop by in the irc channel. I can also take you on a tour in VNC.



help wanted
===
here are some (random and possibly outdated) things that i think would help lemon further, sometimes directly, sometimes by making it more
accesible/interesting to other people. Some understanding of lemon is usually
necessary though. I will be more than happy to explain every detail, but be prepared that it takes some time.
some (messy) notes are also notes1, and search for "todo" in the source files..

* add more standard library functions, operators for strings and lists

* help developing the license

* look into runnig lemon in pypyjs or compiling it to asm.js

* improve the curses frontend, figure out what keys to use

* do more research on or write comparisons of related projects (projectured, cedalion, MPS, eastwest..)

* figure out how to have a better font in pygame (for mathy expressions, for example) compatible with lemon license (search stuff/the_doc.py for 'font')

* improve logging

* integrate some test framework


files
===
* sdl_client.py: the frontend, handles a window, events, drawing. run this one.
* nodes.py: AST classes
* widgets.py textbox, number box, button..
* element.py - both widgets and nodes descend from Element
* tags.py: the results of calling element.render(), text, attribute, child..
* server_frames.py, rpcing_frames.py: the panels: Root, Menu, Info..
* lemon_colors.py: color settings
* lemon_args.py: command line arguments
* notes1: an attempt to migrate all documentation into lemon:)
