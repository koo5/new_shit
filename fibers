	P = Sigma a:A . (Sigma b:B .(f(a) = g(b)))

presheaf on C:
	a functor F: C^op -> Set

representable presheaf
	a presheaf on C is representable if it is naturally isomorphic to a 
	hom-functor h_X := hom_C(_,X):C^op -> Set, which sends an object U : C
	to the hom-set Hom_C(U,X) in C, and which sends a morphism
	a:U'->U in C to the function which sends each morphism f:U->X to the
	composite a.f
	
	The object X is determined uniquely up to isomorphism in C, and is called
	the representing object for the presheaf.

Let C be a locally cartesian closed model category
A dependent type
	b : B |- E(b) : Type
corresponds to a morphism E -> B in C that is a fibration between fibrant objects
(this morphism is the projection operator).

Dependent function type
	b1,b2: B |- E(b1) -> E(b2)):Type
is interpreted as the internal hom [_,_]_C/B*B in the slice category C/B*B after
extending E to the context B*B by pulling back along the two projections p1,p2:B*B->B,
respectively.

Now we talk about "univalent fibrations"
