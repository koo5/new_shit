Only by assuming the univalence axiom can we prove that the loop space of
the circle is equivalent to the integers. This is a typical proof in algebraic
topology. 



Inductive (Nat : Type) :=
  | 0 : Nat
  | suc : Nat -> Nat

*From this definition, Coq automatically generates a recursor/eliminator for Nat.

Inductive (circle : Type) :=
  | base : circle
  | loop : base ~ base

* Coq doesn't accept this inductive definition; in normal inductive types, the
  constructors have to output elements of the type itself.

#Coq has no higher inductive types, but you can sort
#of make them using these "Axioms" (which are apparently just like RDF facts)

Axiom Circle : Type

Axiom base : Circle
Axiom loop : base ~ base

Axiom circle_rec1 : forall (X : Type) (a : X) (l : a ~ a) -> Circle -> X

Axiom circle_rec2 : forall (P : Circle -> Type) (a : P base) (l : a ~ a) . forall( x : Circle) . P x

Axiom circle_rec : forall ( P : Circle -> Type) (a : P base) (l : (transport loop a) ~ a) . forall (x : Circle) . P x

Lemma transport : forall {X:Type}{P:X->Type}{x,x':X}(p:x~x').(P x) -> (P x')

Inductive nat : Type :=
  | z : nat
  | succ : nat -> nat

Inductive int : Type :=
  | pos : nat -> int
  | zero : int
  | neg : nat -> int

HomotopyFiber := {A B : Type} -> f:(A->B) -> sigma(a:A) . Path (f a) b
Contractible := X:Type -> sigma(x:X).forall(x':X). Path x x'

sequenced operations:

do{
	?x = command1(?something)
	?y = command2(?x)
}

= do {
	?y = command2(command1(?something))
}

	?y = command2(command1(?something))
}

imperative can probably be treated as sugar for functional in some kind of way

45/10 = 4 + 5/10 = 4.5
1/3 = 0.3333..

1/3 = sum i=1^inf 3 * (1/10)^i

they get a repeating part if they have factors that aren't factors of the base
they get a non-repeating part if they have factors that are factors of the base
corollary: any number that is coprime to the base will get no fixed part to it's decimal expansion,
any number that shares all factors with the base will have a finite, non-repeating decimal expansion,
and any number which has factors shared with the base along with factors coprime to the base will have
a fixed prefix followed by an infinite repeating part.

x+1 is coprime to x, for all x
